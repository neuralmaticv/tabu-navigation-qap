# üîç Tabu Search for the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP)

This repository contains the presentation and accompanying code exploring the application of Tabu Search, a metaheuristic optimization algorithm, to solve the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) in Artificial Intelligence. The presentation was created as part of the course "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" at the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, University of Banja Luka. The implemented algorithm is based on the paper "Tabu Search Applied to the Quadratic Assignment Problem" by J. Skorin-Kapov.

**Course:** Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

**Presentation (in Serbian):** `presentation/tabu_search.pdf`

**Code:** `code/tabu_navigation.ipynb`

Instances of the QAP can be found in the `instances` directory, which are taken from the QAPLIB library except for the test ones.

**Presentation template credit:** The presentation was created using a modified version of the [MATF presentation template by Nikola Ajzenhamer](https://github.com/ajzenhamernikola/matf-presentation-template/tree/master)
